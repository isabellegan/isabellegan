# About Me
Bridging the intersection of systems and creativity—where data informs decisions, and design shapes experiences. Background in strategy consulting and early-stage venture capital.

Beyond work, I’m…
🌎 An adventurer at heart: Living in Toronto, Montréal, and Singapore sparked my love for travel and learning new languages
🙌 A lifelong athlete: Grew up playing multiple sports and currently training for a half-marathon
✨ An arts aficionado: Concerts, sitcoms, and photography inspire my passion for storytelling
🏔️ Happiest outdoors—whether hiking, chasing sunsets, or stargazing
